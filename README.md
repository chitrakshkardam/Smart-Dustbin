# Smart-Dustbin

# Description:
Implemented a smart dustbin system using Arduino microcontroller technology to automate waste disposal processes. This project utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of waste in the dustbin and servo motors to automate the opening and closing of the dustbin lid.

# Key Components:

Arduino microcontroller
Ultrasonic sensor module
Servo motor
LED indicator
Resistors
Jumper wires
Working Principle:

Utilized Arduino programming to establish control over the ultrasonic sensor module and servo motor.
The ultrasonic sensor module detects the distance of the waste from the dustbin using ultrasonic waves.
Upon detecting the waste within a predefined proximity threshold, the servo motor mechanism opens the dustbin lid automatically.
After a specified duration, the servo motor closes the lid, ensuring proper containment of waste and maintaining cleanliness.
Sequence of Operation:

The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance between the dustbin and the waste.
When the distance falls below a predetermined threshold (e.g., 50 cm), indicating the presence of waste, the servo motor opens the dustbin lid.
After a set delay period (e.g., 3 seconds), the servo motor closes the lid, completing the waste disposal process.
LED indicators provide visual feedback regarding the status of the system operation.

# Project Impact:

Successfully implemented a smart dustbin system, offering automated waste disposal capabilities and enhancing user convenience.
Demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing ultrasonic sensors and servo motors for real-time waste management applications.
Received positive feedback regarding the efficiency and reliability of the smart dustbin system.
